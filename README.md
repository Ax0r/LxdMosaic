# LXDManager

This is an application you can use to do basic managment for multiple instaces
of lxd

## Why ?

Most of the other lxd managers I saw are only used  to manage one lxd instace which
is no good as I have many!

They also dont really touch on profiles or cloud config which I make heavy use
of.

## Installation

The prefered installation is currently docker but the install script should
do the trick (only tested on ubuntu 18.04)

## Docker

1. Install docker && docker-compose

2. cd /var/www/ && git clone https://github.com/turtle0x1/LxdManager.git

3. Change .env.dist to .env and ucommented the enviroment variables setup
    for docker

3. Run `docker-composer up` and this should build the webserver and database

4. Add lxd.local to your hosts file (/etc/hosts ussually)

5. Point your browser to `https://lxd.local:5000` (you can change from port 5000
    in docker-composer.yaml)

## Install script
**Warning this installs apache, mysql-server, php, git and other dependecies its
best to run in a container or an empty vm to avoid clutering your system**

In examples you will find an bash script called install_with_clone.sh this will
handle the installation of dependecies and setup this program.

Once you have run the script you should launch your browser and go to https://host_setup_run_on_ip
or you can add the hosts ip to your host file with the name lxd.local,

It handles the cloning of the repository so you can just do;

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turtle0x1/LxdManager/master/examples/install_with_clone.sh >> installLxdManager.sh`

Then give the script execution permisions

`chmod +x installLxdManger.sh`

Then run bellow to setup the program

`sudo ./installLxdManger.sh`

## Manual

The manual steps for deploying this can be read from the install script which
will handle all the dependecies it should be commented well enough to serve
as instructions!

## Notes

This project was started sometime around 2017 so the code is very meh, it won't
win any prizes.

It will improve over time but it will do for a 0.1 (symfony request obj + symfony
responses will be a good start).

If you take great offence please feel free to open a pull request that improves it
other wise keep the issues related to bugs + feauture requests.

I have opened a bunch of issues for things that I want to implement and need doing
any help would be greatlly appreciated.

### Cloud Config

Cloud config is a incredibly powerfull tool to provision containers on first run.

This program contains the basic functionality to create and manage cloud config
files and deploy them to containers (through profiles) onto one or many hosts.

Most of the information about cloud config can be read here [here](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html)
